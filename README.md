# Hardware

## Linux Single Board Computers (SBCs) 
 - I am able to deliver complex applications that run on Linux
 - I am familiar with writing and maintaining code in the Qt IDE
 - I am confident in developing cross-platform UI applications using [C# monodevelop](https://www.monodevelop.com/)
 - I am confident in developing web applications that run on most SBCs with [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/)
 - I also have experience working with the following Linux hardware platforms:
      - [Friendly Arm User Manual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oycAqawBP5LXR2k4kznN_pqpRAKSmaE2/view?usp=sharing)
      - [SAMA5AD3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eLe5A3R8QMKqDcHl8vZGrN2RFSmSkYRA/view?usp=sharing)
      - [Raspberry Pi Compute](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4/?variant=raspberry-pi-cm4001000)
      - Looking forward to gaining more experience in this field e.g. Beagle Bone, Union Omega...
  
## Micro Controllers
- I am able to deliver complex applications that run on microcontroller devices from 8 bit to 32bit
- I am familiar with writing and maintaining code in C and C++
- I have worked with STM32 ARM devices and smaller microchip devices
- I have practical experience with these peripherals: I2C, SPI, Serial, PMW, ADC, DAC, and PLD (Programmable logic block) 

# Software Demo
I am posting content here to demonstrate some of my skills and abilities.  

## Code Samples

### C applications
- **BinGap.c**: A project from Codility that instructs the programmer to find the number of consecutive 0's in a binary string given any integer value. 
- **Zm5202_Flash.c &.h:** Programming Flash & NVR of a ZWAVE ZM5202 module over SPI via STM32L431 
- **Coords.c:** Obtain the closest coordinate from a given set of coordinates

### C# Applications  

- **BinGap.cs:** A project from Codility that instructs the programmer to find the number of consecutive 0's in a binary string given any integer value. 
- **Gyro.xaml.cs:** A C# WPF application that receives stabilised/Fused XYZ Coordinate data from an embedded controller connected to a mpu9250 OR receives data from an Android app that outputs its sensor data over TCP/IP. 
- **SerialDataAnalyser.cs:** Is a tool I created for viewing and outputting serial data using COMCOM Virtual ports. The application can also be configured as a serial to MQTT bridge.  

### Python Applications
- **BinGap.py:** A project from Codility that instructs the programmer to find the number of consecutive 0's in a binary string given any integer value. 


## Web and IoT
I completed this demonstration to show my understanding of JS, HTML, MQTT, JSON, SVG, and POST/GET.  
- [Mqtt and HTTP Post demo](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxKKL5dipvyvXlYChkrXGTGLB1apzp-SbUMDdXZqYjSVsQPpMRNaxagVdMoDUoX5QEH/exec)
- I can develop complex web applications with Node-Red

Tjaart55/Tjaart55 is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.

The aim of this product was to:
- Build ZWAVE functionality into an existing project.  
- The ZWAVE controller needed to be programmed with a hex file from the chip manufacturer before the application could work. This needed to be added to our manufacturing process.
- The ZWAVE application collected ZWAVE network information and controlled ZWAVE devices according to commands coming from our product's phone application.
